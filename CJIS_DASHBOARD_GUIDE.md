2. **Active Incidents** - Monitor and respond quickly
3. **Failed Login Attempts** - Watch for brute force attacks
4. **Training Compliance** - Ensure all users complete required training
5. **Audit Log Integrity** - Verify hash chains are intact

## üöÄ Quick Start

### View Security Status
1. Login as admin user
2. Click "Security Dashboard" in sidebar
3. Review compliance score and alerts

### Respond to Incident
1. Go to Security Dashboard
2. Click on "Incidents" tab
3. Select incident and choose action (contain/recover)

### Check Compliance
1. Go to Security Dashboard
2. Click "Compliance" tab
3. Review policy area scores
4. Generate compliance report

## üß™ Testing the System

Run the API test script:
```bash
chmod +x test-cjis-api.sh
./test-cjis-api.sh
```

Or manually check key endpoints:
```bash
# Check compliance score
curl http://localhost:5050/api/compliance-governance/compliance/score

# View security metrics
curl http://localhost:5050/api/security-dashboard/metrics

# Get audit logs
curl http://localhost:5050/api/security-dashboard/audit-logs?limit=5
```

## üìù Database Tables

The CJIS implementation added 35+ security tables including:
- `cjis_audit_log` - Audit trail with integrity protection
- `security_incidents` - Security incident tracking
- `incident_response` - Incident management
- `personnel_security` - Personnel records
- `security_training` - Training assignments
- `mobile_devices` - Device management
- `compliance_reports` - Compliance documentation

## üîî Monitoring & Alerts

The system automatically monitors for:
- Failed login attempts (>5 = lockout)
- Impossible travel (geographic anomalies)
- Excessive data access
- Configuration changes
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Training expiration
- Compliance violations

## üìà Compliance Reporting

Generate compliance reports via:
1. Dashboard UI - Click "Generate Report" button
2. API - `GET /api/compliance-governance/compliance/report`
3. Scheduled - Reports auto-generate monthly

Reports include:
- Overall compliance score
- Policy area assessments
- Security metrics
- Violation details
- Recommendations
- Executive summary

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Admin Access Required**: Most CJIS features require admin role
2. **Audit Everything**: All CJI access is logged
3. **MFA Required**: Enable MFA for all users handling CJI
4. **Training Mandatory**: Users must complete security training
5. **Regular Reviews**: Check compliance weekly

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading?
- Ensure you're logged in as admin
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API is running: `curl http://localhost:5050/health`

### Low Compliance Score?
- Review each policy area in dashboard
- Check for expired training
- Ensure MFA is enabled for all users
- Verify audit logging is active

### Missing Data?
- Run migrations: `npm run migrate`
- Check database connection
- Verify environment variables
